        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: Analyst</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">As the capabilities of low-resource field testing have begun to expand to incorporate more complex diagnostic technologies, many of these devices remain tethered to large heaters requiring relatively high-power inputs. Highly efficient microheaters would enable miniaturization of devices for more economic and effective heating with high temperatures and sustained incubation. This work reports the development and application of resistive microheaters printed with nanosilver ink for improved methods of automated sample heating in paper-based point-of-care (POC) and in-field diagnostics. Resistance is easily predicted, and shapes can be altered to fit space and heat-transfer needs, sustained and discrete heating of precise regions are possible. Here, we demonstrate both isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 65 °C and bacterial culture at 37 °C using our microheaters. Printed nanosilver microheaters are easily integrated into reactions that require low-power battery heating, can sustain heating for 16-hour incubations, and cost between 0.17 and 0.58 US dollars each. Further, the microheaters are reusable, stable over 6 months, and can be wetted without degradation or reduction in conductivity. These versatile printed microheaters enable thermal control for a variety of low power heating applications.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: NIP & Digital Fabrication Conference</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">It is known that the foodborne pathogen E.coli O157:H7 from contaminated food can cause severe disease in our bodies and even death. Therefore, the detection of foodborne pathogens in our daily diet is crucial for global public health. We have previously reported an affordable, rapid, and simple method for detecting E.coli O157:H7 that uses inkjet patterning to create functionalized biosensing test strips detecting the target organism down to 102 CFU/ml. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the response variations of our biosensors for detecting the same concentration of the target in two aspects: the comparison of various image segmentation methods and the optimization of the number of print layers.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: Lab on a Chip</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">While identifying acute HIV infection is critical to providing prompt treatment to HIV-positive individuals and preventing transmission, existing laboratory-based testing methods are too complex to perform at the point of care. Specifically, molecular techniques can detect HIV RNA within 8–10 days of transmission but require laboratory infrastructure for cold-chain reagent storage and extensive sample preparation performed by trained personnel. Here, we demonstrate our point-of-care microfluidic rapid and autonomous analysis device (microRAAD) that automatically detects HIV RNA from whole blood. Inside microRAAD, we incorporate vitrified amplification reagents, thermally-actuated valves for fluidic control, and a temperature control circuit for low-power heating. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) products are visualized using a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), resulting in an assay limit of detection of 100 HIV-1 RNA copies when performed as a standard tube reaction. Even after three weeks of room-temperature reagent storage, microRAAD automatically isolates the virus from whole blood, amplifies HIV-1 RNA, and transports amplification products to the internal LFIA, detecting as few as 3 × 105 HIV-1 viral particles, or 2.3 × 107 virus copies per mL of whole blood, within 90 minutes. This integrated microRAAD is a low-cost and portable platform to enable automated detection of HIV and other pathogens at the point of care.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: Analytica Chimica Acta</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">The use of aptamers as capture biomolecules has been proposed as a promising alternative to overcome the harsh environmental conditions of industrial manufacturing processes, and to enhance the performance under real, complex, conditions. In this work, we present the feasibility of using aptameric DNA sequences, covalently conjugated to 4-aminothiophenol-gold nanoparticle complexes for the sensitive and highly specific detection of E. coli O157:H7 via surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis. Low concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 were detected and quantified within 20 min in both pure culture (∼101 CFU mL−1) and ground beef samples (∼102 CFU mL−1). The SERS intensity response showed a strong negative linear correlation (r2 = 0.995) with increasing concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 (ranging from 102 to 106 CFU mL−1). High specificity was achieved at genus (L. monocytogenes, S. aureus S. typhimurium) species (E. coli B1201) and serotype (E. coli O55:H7) level, demonstrating with 95% of confidence that the interferent microorganisms tested generated a Raman signal response not significantly different from the background (p = 0.786).

        This work evaluates the incorporation of aptameric DNA sequences as bio capture molecules exclusively. The successful performance presented using non-modified citrate reduced GNPs, is promising for potential low-cost, high-throughput applications. The findings might be applied simultaneously to the detection of a wide variety of foodborne pathogens in a multiplexed fashion employing unique Raman probes and strain-specific aptamer sequences.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: Molecular Neurodegeneration</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">α-Synuclein (aSyn) aggregation is thought to play a central role in neurodegenerative disorders termed synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mouse aSyn contains a threonine residue at position 53 that mimics the human familial PD substitution A53T, yet in contrast to A53T patients, mice show no evidence of aSyn neuropathology even after aging. Here we studied the neurotoxicity of human A53T, mouse aSyn, and various human-mouse chimeras in cellular and in vivo models as well as their biochemical properties relevant to aSyn pathobiology. We report that mouse aSyn is less neurotoxic than the human A53T variant as a result of inhibitory effects of two C-terminal amino acid substitutions on membrane-induced aSyn aggregation and aSyn-mediated vesicle permeabilization. Our findings highlight the importance of membrane-induced self-assembly in aSyn neurotoxicity and suggest that inhibiting this process by targeting the C-terminal domain could slow neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathy disorders.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Advanced bisphenol A (BPA) lateral flow assays (LFAs) that use multiple nanosystems are reported. The assays use three nanosystems: gold nanostars, gold nanocubes, and gold nanorods, which are rarely applied in LFAs, compared with general gold nanoparticles that are referred to as gold nanospheres in this paper. These various nanosystems are bound to anti‐BPA antibodies and applied in LFAs to develop advanced BPA LFAs; the developed LFAs show differing BPA detection performance, as well as different visible colors, optical intensities, limits of detection, and application ranges. Advanced BPA LFAs that use multiple gold nano‐object shapes are successfully developed, and the geometry effects of diverse gold nanosystems coupled with anti‐BPA antibodies and the potential applications of regular BPA LFAs are explored.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: Electrochimica Acta</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">Real-time detection of heavy metal traces from industrial waste is key to control any potential environmental pollution by early critical point intervention. This opens a market niche for real-time, portable, and cost-efficient devices for environmental and biosafety monitoring. Despite the rapid growth of heavy metal monitoring as a research field, and the promising performance of an increasing number of novel platforms reported, the chances to transfer the lab-scale platforms developed to successful commercialization stages are dramatically low.

        This work proposes for the first time the use of ink-jet printed gold electrodes as a reliable, stable and fully-scalable approach for aptamer-based detection of mercury (Hg2+) traces in water and organic solvents. A controlled fabrication process was demonstrated by keeping the 90% of the charge transfer (RCT) values obtained from the as-fabricated electrodes (n = 11) within ± 1 SD (RSD = 2.92%) from the mean value and following a mesokurtic normal-like distribution (p = 0.905). The as-fabricated platform achieved a LOD of 0.01 ppm in water and enhanced sensitivity of 2-fold when tested in organic solvents, with a LOD of 0.005 ppm which is far below the minimal sensitive required for practical implementation, according to the EPA stipulations. Finally, the aptamer-based gold ink-jet printed platform provided with enough evidence to state that the signal collected from Hg2+ was significantly different (p < 0.001) from the signal provided by interferent ions tested (arsenic, lead and cadmium) at the same concentration (50 ppm), evidencing a high specificity. From the best of our knowledge, this work reports for the first time a gold inkjet-printed impedimetric platform for aptamer-based detection of Hg2+ in organic solvents, showing promising viability for future prototyping and scaling-up.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Meeting Abstracts</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">A variety of sensors have been developed at the laboratory level within the past few decades. However, very few of these reached the market and are being used today.

        We used roll-to-roll processing to develop field deployable flexible electrochemical sensors for the detection of environmental pollutants such as mercury and organophoshorous pesticides. The sensors are based on injket printed interdigitated gold electrodes, which were further functionalized for detection of organophosphorous pesticides and mercury, respectively. For the pesticide sensors, a mesh of zirconium oxide fibers was deposited via roll-to-roll on the electrodes, and the response to the target was quantified impedimetrically.

        Mercury ions were detected upon the functionalization of the interdigitated electrodes with specific DNA aptamers, while the impedimetric transduction was maintained.

        Sensors stability, selectivity and detection limits were measured for laboratory conditions and in real food and soil samples. The sensors show similar characteristics with the state of the art in the field, are field deployable and able to be manufactured in a consistent and repeatable fashion.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: Small</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">The increasing incidence of infectious outbreaks from contaminated food and water supply continues imposing a global burden for food safety, creating a market demand for on‐site, disposable, easy‐to‐use, and cost‐efficient devices. Despite of the rapid growth of biosensors field and the generation of breakthrough technologies, more than 80% of the platforms developed at lab‐scale never will get to meet the market. This work aims to provide a cost‐efficient, reliable, and repeatable approach for the detection of foodborne pathogens in real samples. For the first time an optimized inkjet printing platform is proposed taking advantage of a carefully controlled nanopatterning of novel carboxyl‐functionalized aptameric ink on a nitrocellulose substrate for the highly efficient detection of E. coli O157:H7 (25 colony forming units (CFU) mL−1 in pure culture and 233 CFU mL−1 in ground beef) demonstrating the ability to control the variation within ±1 SD for at least 75% of the data collected even at very low concentrations. From the best of the knowledge this work reports the lowest limit of detection of the state of the art for paper‐based optical detection of E. coli O157:H7, with enough evidence (p > 0.05) to prove its high specificity at genus, species, strain, and serotype level.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: bioRxiv</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">Early Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing is critical to preventing transmission and providing treatment to HIV-positive individuals, yet an estimated 30% of HIV-positive individuals do not know their status because of barriers to early diagnosis. Readily accessible, highly sensitive, and rapid diagnostic tests would enable patients’ prompt treatment with anti-retroviral therapies and reduce transmission. However, existing HIV diagnostic technologies either do not detect early stages of infection or require multiple days of laboratory processing, delaying notification of patients’ status.

        Molecular techniques that amplify HIV RNA can detect the earliest stages of infection, within 8-10 days after transmission. However, most of these molecular assays require cold-chain storage of reagents, significant sample preparation, and extensive laboratory infrastructure. To achieve early detection, we developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay with a limit of detection of 10 HIV-1 RNA copies visualized by eye using a lateral flow immunoassay. To demonstrate automated sample-to-answer detection of HIV, we incorporate dried amplification reagents and wax valves in low-cost substrates with resistive heating elements and circuitry. By combining controlled heating with paper’s capillary flow, our assembled device automatically isolates viral particles from human blood samples, amplifies HIV-1 RNA, and transports products to a detection zone. We determine that as few as 105 HIV-1 viral particles can be separated from whole blood, amplified, and visually detected within 90 minutes of sample addition into our Microfluidic Rapid and Autonomous Analysis Device (microRAAD). The low-cost and automated attributes of microRAAD demonstrate its utility as a point-of-care testing platform.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Printing technologies recently have been applied to environmental pollution and food safety testing applications because there is more and more demand for inexpensive, portable and functional devices to be used for monitoring food and environment, such as enzyme-based biosensors [1] [2]. A system for printing nanoliter DNA based solution droplets on a lateral flow test strip with improved sensitivity for detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) is described in this article. We will present an overview of the results obtained with our printing process and the image analysis of the responses in the test strips. The printing process includes the precise control of droplet volume, the design of the print masks, and functional printing of the DNA-based solution. We create an image analysis system to read the responses of the test strips to the foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7) and determine the relationship between the responses and the concentration of the E. coli. Furthermore, we confirm that our printed test strips can successfully detect the presence of E . coli O157:H7 with a concentration as low as 102 CFU/ml.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">We report on the development of a new range-extended bisphenol A (BPA) detection method that uses a surface-enhanced Raman scattering lateral flow assay (SERS-LFA) binary system. The assay includes high-SERS-performance gold nanoparticles, i.e., 40 nm gold nanostars (GNSs) and 4-aminothiolphenol (4-ATP) as a Raman reporter. To demonstrate the performance of this SERS-LFA kit in BPA detection, we tested BPA stock solutions with concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 60 ppb. The GNSs were coated with 4-ATP and then anti-BPA antibody serving as a biorecognition reagent to acquire both visual and Raman signals after application in the BPA SERS-LFA kit. The limit of detection for the SERS signals was 0.073 ppb, which is 205 and 20 times more sensitive than those of visual intensity and color intensity quantifications, respectively. The range of quantification of the SERS signals was doubled that of color intensity quantification. The SERS-LFA binary kit successfully detected BPA and provided more accurate results over a broader concentration range (2-fold) than that of optical intensity.</p>

To address these limitations, a more stable and more sensitive biosensor is developed by designing strategies for modifying the surfaces of GNPs with polyethylene glycol and then testing their effectiveness and sensitivity toward BPA in an LFA. Without the application of any enhancement strategy, this modified BPA LFA can achieve a naked‐eye limit of detection (LOD) of 0.8 ng mL−1, which is 12.5 times better than the LOD of regular BPA LFAs, and a quantitative LOD of 0.472 ng mL−1. This modified LFA has the potential to be applied to the detection of various antigens.</p>

The synthesis of gold-decorated polystyrene particles (Au-PS), and their incorporation in a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) with improved sensitivity for detection of the model pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) were described in this article. The synthesis of the Au-PS particles occurred through the citrate reduction method. Then the particles underwent surface modification through coating with branched polyethylenimine, followed by grafting of the anti-E. coli O157:H7 antibody. The effect of Au-PS particle size and of the surface coverage on the detection limit of the assay was investigated. The Au-PS particles with 0.46 μm PS and 10% Au surface coverage achieved 500 CFU·mL−1 limit of detection (LOD) for E. coli O157:H7 in apple juice, ground beef, and spiked buffer solutions. Furthermore, these particles achieved 100 CFU·mL−1 LOD when the secondary a signal amplification reaction via gold reduction method was used. While the antibody-antigen interaction has a well-known role in detection, a precise optimization of the Au-PS particles used in LFIA assays can significantly affect performance. In our perception, Au nanoparticles coverage on sub-micron sized polystyrene particles was the critical factor that allowed reaching the reported low concentration of E. coli O157:H7 in real food samples.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: Journal of colloid and interface science</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">Micro/nano-lithographic techniques are usually employed as a straightforward process for roughening a thin-film Au surface for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). However, a topographical pattern with deepened edges is difficult to control in a rapid and environmental-friendly way. In this study, a simple physical procedure is proposed for tailoring a thin-film Au surface with triangular nanostructures using nano-indentation technique. The as-fabricated nano-indented cavities on Au (nAu) were structured as a characterization substrate for SERS. By calculating the geometries of nAu and the increase of surface area as a function of the concentration of chemically adsorbed 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (NTB), a combined chemical and electromagnetic effect was estimated. Particularly-made nAu was adjusted for examining chemically adsorbed NTB molecules with differently intensified Raman-active groups by tuning the indentation depth and the tip-to-tip displacement. SERS enhancement factor on a specific NTB/nAu could be increased to 2.1 × 106.</p>

        <p class="MainPicDescription">Journal: 2009 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Nano/Molecular Medicine and Engineering</p>
        <p class="MainPicDescription">The technique of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) provides high informational content on the chemical structure of the probed substances, which makes this method a very promising tool in biomedical spectroscopy. In this study, we presented a novel method that utilizes nanoindentation to generate graphically indented patterns on Au surface. The modified Au surface was thereafter relevant to the applications of SERS. 5, 5'-Dithio-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and Rhodamine 6G (R6G) were particularly grafted on the modified Au surface to verify an enhanced Raman Effect. DTNB was chemically adsorbed, while R6G was physically adsorbed on the modified Au surface. The particularly modified Au surfaces exhibited significant SERS enhancements and possibly applied for microorganism detection.</p>
