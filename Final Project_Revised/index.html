					<p id="page2Description">In this data visualization comparing house market growing, San Francisco Bay Area, including San Francisco and San Jose, obviously has shown outstanding house price growth over the past six years. The plotted lines for both cities ascend significantly, indicating a strong upward trend in housing prices. San Francisco, in particular, exhibits substantial price appreciation, making it one of the most competitive housing markets in the dataset.

						On the other hand, when contrasting the impressive growth of the Bay Area with Chicago, we observe a relatively slower pace of house price appreciation. Chicago's housing market shows a more gradual increase in prices over time, suggesting a more stable and less volatile market compared to the San Francisco Bay Area.

						The remaining cities, including Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Seattle, display varying degrees of house price growth within the given period. Some of these cities demonstrate steady and continuous price increases, while others experience fluctuations in their housing markets.</p>

				<p id="page3Description">In this data visualization of the housing market, we have explored the trends in both house pricing growth and the number of homes sold in different regions. The data reveals some interesting insights, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area.

					While the San Francisco Bay area exhibits significant house pricing growth, we observe that the number of homes sold in this region is relatively low compared to other major cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Diego. This contrast raises intriguing questions and leads to the formulation of a hypothesis.

					My hypothesis is that the limited number of homes sold in the San Francisco Bay area may be attributed to various factors, such as a competitive real estate market, high demand leading to increased property values, and potential challenges in affordability for prospective buyers. Additionally, other factors like housing supply constraints and the presence of a strong rental market may also contribute to the observed trend.</p>
